# Etch-A-Sketch Web App

## Project Overview
In this project, you'll create a fun toy that combines elements of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch to sharpen your DOM manipulation skills. This browser-based drawing app allows users to sketch freely on a grid by hovering or clicking over cells, and it will challenge your understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build an interactive sketchpad using DOM manipulation techniques. Itâ€™s designed to help you practice JavaScript methods, CSS properties, and user interaction handling.

## Features
- **Customizable Grid**: Create a dynamic grid where users can specify the number of rows and columns.
- **Drawing Functionality**: Users should be able to draw on the grid by hovering or clicking on the cells.
- **Reset Button**: Add functionality to reset the grid and start over.
- **Optional Features**:
  - Change grid size on the fly.
  - Implement different drawing modes (e.g., random colors, grayscale, etc.).
  - Erase functionality.
  - Toggle between drawing on hover or click.
  
  ## Skills Used
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically create and manipulate grid elements using JavaScript.
- **CSS Styling**: Style the grid and interface for a smooth user experience.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Implement hover, click, and reset functionality.

## Tools & Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure the webpage and grid.
- **CSS3**: Style the grid and add custom layouts.
- **JavaScript**: Create, manipulate, and add interactivity to the grid using DOM methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice using DOM manipulation to create dynamic elements.
- Improve understanding of event listeners and handling user input.
- Gain experience with CSS Grid for layout design.
- Learn how to plan and structure a small JavaScript project from start to finish.
